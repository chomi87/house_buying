# So you want to buy a house
... but as many, you don't know to make sense of the investment.

This is my situation right now, so I built this tool to try to make sense of the numbers.

## What this tool does
This tool allows to simulate different scenarios when buying and reselling a house.
- Given a few inputs:
    - compute the mortgage rate
    - display the evolution of the residual debt
    - display the monthly ratio of interests and repayment
    - breakdown of non-recoverable costs
    - compute when you would break even if selling at a given price 
    
-  

## What this won't do
- predict the selling price of your house
- give you financial advice (tell you if to buy or when to sell)
- make a prediction of your future financial situation

## Parameters
### Purchase info
- **Buying price**: the price of the house you will buy
- **Mortgage value (%)**: the percentage of the house covered by a mortgage
- **Fixed expenses**: include notary, agency fees, transition taxes, inspections ...
- **Mortgage duration**: in years
- **Yearly interest rate (%)**: we considere a fixed rate

### Selling info
- **Hypothetical sales price**: make hypothesis on the selling price of your house
- **Saved from rent**: how much would you have paid of rent each month?
